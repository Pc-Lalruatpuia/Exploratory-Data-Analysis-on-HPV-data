# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-HPV-data
The purpose of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on HPV diagnosis data.
## Goals of the Project
1.To Explore the Dataset using Pandas <br/>
2.To Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to determine the odds of getting HPV in different sociodemographic parameters.<br/>
3.To determine the association between different variables using various statistical tests<br/>
4.To determine which diagnosis(Urine or Swab) is more effective.
## Context of the Data
1. The data is collected by Dr Zomuanpuii Colney,Research Scientist,Viral and Diagnostic Laboratory, Zormam Medical College,Mizoram
2. The data contains various sociodemographic parameters of 516 individuals.
3. The data contains type of HPV genotypers found in each individuals
4. The data contains the means of diagnosis used to detect the HPV.
## Results
1.The urine test may have lower sensitivity (misses 45 cases that the cervical swab catches).
  The cervical swab appears to be a more sensitive detection method for HPV.
  There are a few cases where urine detects HPV but cervical swab does not.<br/>
2.HPV Type 16 and 18 are the most frequently detected.
  Many individuals have multiple HPV types detected .
  Some genotypes rarely occur alone, but rather in combination with others.
